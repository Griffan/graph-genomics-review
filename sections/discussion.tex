\section{Discussion}

%We have presented recent work on pangenomic methods based on lossless pangenomic models.

%JME: following a recommendation from Jonas, I'm leaving this paragraph in discussion for possible inclusion later

%Among the graph mappers for variation graphs, a theme has emerged in their accuracy. 
%They typically do not improve mapping accuracy over the entire genome compared to state-of-the-art linear mappers. 
%However, they do significantly improve read mapping accuracy \emph{over variants} \cite{Garrison_2019, Rakocevic_2019, Kim_2019}. 
%In this, we see a concrete example of pangenomic methods mitigating reference bias. 
%%The unimproved (and often slightly diminished) performance over the rest of the genome probably indicates a combination of the relative nascency of the graph mapping tools and the burden of more complicated computational heuristics.
%\todo{JAS: Would the above paragraph fit better in the discussion?}

  % figure out how to use this
In precision medicine, we seek accurate inference of a given patient genome.
Improving our prior model for what sequences we expect to see will reduce the time and cost required to infer a patient genome.
This does not only help us when we are genotyping known variants.
If most of the sequence and variation in any given individual is also found in the reference pangenome which we use, then we are left with a smaller set of sequences that do not map to the reference to consider when we attempt to infer novel variation.

\item Viz Discussion: SH: I think it is important to say, that there are such a low number of tools out there specialized in visualizing genome graphs, they are not even classified in a recent genomic data visualization review by Nusrat et al. \cite{Nusrat_2019}
