  %  \caption{\label{fig:genvpan} Genomic versus pangenomic sequence analysis patterns.
      %Top left: In reference based genomic analyses, all genomes ($a \ldots f$) are compared to each other via their relationship to the reference genome $R$.
      %Top right: In a pangenomic setting, we attempt to model direct relationships between all the genomes in our analysis, of which a particular reference $R$ is chosen arbitrarily.
      %Bottom left: When extending our analysis with a new genome, $\Delta$, we add it to the genomic model by comparing it to reference $R$.
      %Bottom right: In contrast, adding a new genome to a pangenomic analysis compares it directly with all other genomes in the model.
